DOM Manipulation Sample Project
This is a simple HTML and JavaScript project that demonstrates how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the appearance of elements in a webpage.

Getting Started
To view the project, open the index.html file in your web browser.

Description
The index.html file contains a simple webpage with a <div> element and an <h3> element inside it.

The JavaScript code in script.js is used to manipulate the HTML of the elements on the page.

Usage
Open index.html in your web browser to see the initial state of the webpage.

The JavaScript code in script.js does the following:

It selects the <div> element and changes its background color, height, and width.
It selects the "change" <h3> element and changes its text color, margin, padding, font size, and font weight.
After running the JavaScript code, refresh the webpage to see the changes applied to the elements.
